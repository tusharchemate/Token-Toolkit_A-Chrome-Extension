# Privacy Policy for Tooken Toolkit

Effective Date: October 4, 2024

Thank you for using *Tooken Toolkit**, developed by **Tushar Chemate**. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you use our Chrome extension.

## 1. Data We Collect

Our extension collects and processes the following data during its operation:

- **Authorization Tokens**: The extension captures authorization tokens (usually from the "Authorization" header in HTTP requests) when interacting with specific allowed domains.
- **Request Information**: Information such as the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), URL, authority (domain), and path of requests made to allowed domains.
- **Active Tab Information**: We monitor the active tab ID to ensure that the extension only interacts with the tab you are currently using.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

We use the collected data for the following purposes:
- **Token Capture**: The tokens we capture are stored temporarily during your session and are used for purposes like authentication with internal APIs and services.
- **Session Management**: The active tab and associated request data are used to ensure that token capture occurs only from the active tab you're working with, maintaining session accuracy.

## 3. How We Protect Your Data

- **Data Encryption**: The collected data, including tokens and request details, are stored in memory only during the active session and are not persisted after the session ends.
- **Limited Access**: Data is only accessible by the extension during your active browsing session and is not shared with any third parties.

## 4. Data Retention

- We do **not** store any data permanently. All data (tokens and request information) is discarded once the tab is closed or when the active tab changes.
- The extension only retains session-based data for as long as you are actively using it.

## 5. User Control

You have full control over the data collected:
- **Token Retrieval**: You can manually retrieve the captured token and general request information anytime via the extension's interface.
- **No Data Sharing**: We do not share your data with any third parties. All data is kept local to your session and never transmitted externally.

## 6. Host Permissions

The extension only requests host permissions for domains that are explicitly trusted and relevant to its functionality. These permissions are used solely to allow the extension to capture tokens and request data for authorized actions.

## 7. Third-Party Services

We do **not** share your data with any third-party services or partners. All data collected is used exclusively within the extension to fulfill its purpose.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted here with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your data.
